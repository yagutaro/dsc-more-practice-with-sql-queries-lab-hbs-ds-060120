    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll run through some practice questions to refresh your knowledge of SQL Queries!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `GROUP BY` statements in SQL to apply aggregate functions like: `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `SUM`\n",
    "- Decide and perform whichever type of join is best for retrieving desired data\n",
    "- Use the `HAVING` clause to compare different aggregates\n",
    "- Write subqueries to decompose complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "As in previous labs, we'll make use of the `sqlite3` library as well as Pandas. By combining them, we'll be able to write queries as Python strings, and make sure that the results are always returned as a Pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by loading both libraries and connecting to the database we'll be using for this lab, `data.sqlite`. You may remember this database from a previous lab. As a refresher, here's the ERD diagram for this database: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import the necessary libraries `pandas` and `sqlite3` \n",
    "* Establish a connection to the database `data.sqlite` \n",
    "* Get the `cursor` from the connection and store it in the variable `c` "
